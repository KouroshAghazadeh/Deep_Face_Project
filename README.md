Deep face project

we are going to build a face swap program which is a simplified version of the “DeepFaceLab” project, using OpenCV. 
Basically, we want to take a source Image of the person with the face we are interested in and a destination image where we want to insert that face to make a new image like the destination image
but with the face from the source image. we are creating new face with seamless cloning and Triangulation.
